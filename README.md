# House Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition


This repository contains my solution for the [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition. The challenge is to predict the final sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables that describe various aspects of the properties.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict the sale price of homes based on various features like overall quality, neighborhood, year built, square footage, etc. This is a regression problem where we aim to minimize the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

## My Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the relationships between various features and the target variable (SalePrice)
- Investigated data distributions and identified outliers
- Explored correlations between features
- Visualized key insights through plots and charts

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using appropriate strategies (imputation, dropping, etc.)
- Addressed outliers to improve model robustness
- Encoded categorical variables 
- Applied log transformation to the target variable to normalize its distribution

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new meaningful features from existing ones
- Selected important features based on correlation and importance scores
- Applied feature scaling to ensure model stability

### 4. Model Selection and Training
I experimented with several regression models:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Stacked models (ensemble approach)

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used cross-validation to find optimal hyperparameters
- Applied grid search and random search techniques

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models using Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE)
- Used K-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness
- Analyzed feature importance to gain deeper insights

### 7. Making Predictions
- Generated predictions on the test set
- Prepared submission files in the required format

## Results

My best performing model achieved a score of [YOUR_SCORE] on the private leaderboard, which placed me in the top [YOUR_PERCENTILE] of participants. The final solution was an ensemble of [YOUR_MODEL_COMBINATION], which proved effective at capturing both linear and non-linear relationships in the data.
